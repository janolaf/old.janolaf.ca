Podman will automatically create the necessary volume for your image if you do not specify a location.

Most guides recommend doing something like this:

```bash
podman container run -d \
    --name jupyter \
    -p 6000:8888 \
    -v jupyter-work:/home/jovyan/work:Z \
    jupyter/scipy-notebook
```

This is okay, but then we have to get the token from the terminal. You run `podman logs jupyter`, copy the string after `token=`, it is all quite clunky really. 

What we can do is create our own token or disable the token by adding `"start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token=''"`  after scipy-notebook. 

If you want to create a token add ``--NotebookApp.token='my_token'``, replacing `my_token` with whatever you like. Much better than a random string of gibberish.

If systemd is managing the container, and we will be generating a systemd service file, we can auto update the container as well by adding a `'--label io.containers.autoupdate={local,registry}'`. 

If you want to run JupyterLab, `-e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes`.

In the example below, we are going to access Jupyter Notebooks
from port 6000. The container internal port is 8888.

```bash
podman container run -d \
    --name jupyter \
    --label io.containers.autoupdate=registry \
    -p 6000:8888 \
    -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes \
    -v /home/user/jupyter:/home/jovyan/work:Z \
    docker.io/jupyter/scipy-notebook start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token=''
```

With the above command we create a container named "jupyter", accessible from `http://localhost:6000`. Files will be saved and accessible from the host at `~/jupyter`. Using Jupyterâ€™s scipy-notebook image from Docker.io. Podman will check docker.io for new images. Notebook token is disabled.

Check if the container is running properly

```bash
podman container ps
```

If there's a problem, run `podman logs jupyter`.

## Generating systemd service file

If everything is working as intended, all that is left is to generate the systemd service file, enable it and see if it works.

If it does not already exist, create the systemd user directory in your home directory.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
```

Then generate the systemd service file.

```bash
podman generate systemd \
	--user \
	--new \
	--name jupyter \
	-f /home/user/.config/systemd/user/
``` 

This will create container-jupyter.service in `~/.config/systemd/user/`. If you do not use `--name` you will get a service file named `container-dg6464323fsdf34536`...

After creating the service file, reload systemd.

```bash
Systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

Stop the jupyter container.

```bash
podman stop jupyter
```

Enable and start container-jupyter.service.

```bash
Systemctl --user enable --now container-jupyter.service
```

Check if everything worked

```bash
Systemctl --user status container-jupyter
```

```bash
podman container ps jupyter
```

If you want Jupyter notebook to be accessible when the user is not logged in, you will need to run 

```bash
loginctl enable-linger user
```
